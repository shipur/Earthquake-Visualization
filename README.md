## Earthquake-Visualization

### Visualize Global Earthquake Data
In this project, I have visualized earthquakes occurring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes all earthquake data for the Past 7 Days. I have also included an additional layer of tectonic plates to understand the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.

Technology stack used in developing this web application is as follows:
leaflet.js
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript
GeoJSON
